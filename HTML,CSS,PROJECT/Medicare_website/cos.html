        <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
           <p> Your health care provider will examine you and ask about your personal and family medical history.<br><br>
            
            Several wrinkle treatment options are available to help smooth wrinkles or make them less noticeable.<br><br>

            <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
            
            <li><b>Laser resurfacing:</b><br>In ablative (wounding) laser resurfacing, a laser beam destroys the outer layer of skin (epidermis) and heats the underlying skin (dermis). This stimulates the growth of new collagen fibers. As the wound heals, smoother, tighter skin forms. Laser resurfacing can't eliminate excessive or sagging skin.</li><br>
            <li><b>Photodynamic rejuvenation:</b><br><br>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) can treat fine wrinkles caused by sun exposure. You may need repeat treatments, but recovery for PDT is shorter than it is with laser resurfacing.</li><br>
            <li><b>Chemical peel:</b><br> Your doctor applies a chemical solution to the skin to remove the top layers. The skin that grows back after a chemical peel is smoother. Depending on the depth of the peel, you may need several treatments before you see a difference in your skin. Redness lasts up to several weeks. Possible side effects include scarring, infection, and lightening or darkening of skin color.</li><br>
            <li><b>Dermabrasion:</b><br>Dermabrasion sands down the surface layer of skin with a rapidly rotating brush. New skin grows in its place. You may need to undergo the procedure more than once.</li><br>
            <li><b>Microdermabrasion:</b><br>Similar to dermabrasion, this technique removes only a fine layer of skin. You'll need a series of treatments over months to produce modest, temporary results. If you have rosacea or tiny red veins on your face, this technique could make the condition worse.</li><br>
            <li><b>Soft tissue fillers:</b><br>Soft tissue fillers, which include fat, collagen and hyaluronic acid (Restylane, Juvederm, others), can be injected into wrinkles on your face. They plump and smooth wrinkles and furrows. You may experience temporary swelling, redness and bruising in the treated area. The effect of most products is temporary. </li><br>
