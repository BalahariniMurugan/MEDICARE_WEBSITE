        <h1>Optical Treatment</h1>
        <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
           <p> Your health care provider will examine you and ask about your personal and family medical history.<br><br>
            
            The ophthalmologist likely will perform the following eye tests:<br><br>

            <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
            
            <li><b>A routine eye exam:</b><br>Your eye doctor will check your vision and your ability to perceive colors and measure your side (peripheral) vision. </li><br>
            <li><b>Ophthalmoscopy: </b><br>During this examination, your doctor shines a bright light into your eye and examines the structures at the back of your eye. This eye test evaluates the optic disk, where the optic nerve enters the retina in your eye. The optic disk becomes swollen in about one-third of <br><br>people with optic neuritis.</li><br>
            <li><b>Pupillary light reaction test:</b><br>Your doctor may move a flashlight in front of your eyes to see how your pupils respond when they're exposed to bright light. If you have optic neuritis, your pupils won't constrict as much as pupils in healthy eyes would when exposed to light.</li><br>
            <li><b>Optical coherence tomography (OCT)</b><br>This test measures the thickness of the eye's retinal nerve fiber layer, which is often thinner from optic neuritis.</li><br>
            <li><b>Visual field test:</b><br>This test measures the peripheral vision of each eye to determine if there is any vision loss. Optic neuritis can cause any pattern of visual field loss.</li><br>
            <li><b>Visual evoked response:</b><br> During this test, you sit before a screen on which an alternating checkerboard pattern is displayed. Attached to your head are wires with small patches to record your brain's responses to what you see on the screen. This type of test tells your doctor if the electrical signals to your brain are slower than normal as a result of optic nerve damage.</li><br>
            </ul>
