        <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
           <p> Your health care provider will examine you and ask about your personal and family medical history.<br><br>
            
            Many different tests are used to diagnose heart disease. Besides blood tests and a chest X-ray, tests to diagnose heart disease can include:<br><br>

            <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
            
            <li><b>Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG):</b><br> An ECG is a quick and painless test that records the electrical signals in the heart. It can tell if the heart is beating too fast or too slowly.</li><br>
            <li><b>Holter monitoring: </b><br>A Holter monitor is a portable ECG device that's worn for a day or more to record the heart's activity during daily activities. This test <br><br>detect irregular heartbeats that aren't found during a regular ECG exam.</li><br>
            <li><b>Echocardiogram: </b><br>This noninvasive exam uses sound waves to create detailed images of the heart in motion. It shows how blood moves through the heart and heart valves. An echocardiogram can help determine if a valve is narrowed or leaking.</li><br>
            <li><b>Exercise tests or stress tests:</b><br>These tests often involve walking on a treadmill or riding a stationary bike while the heart is monitored. Exercise tests help reveal how the heart responds to physical activity and whether heart disease symptoms occur during exercise. If you can't exercise, you might be given medications.</li><br>
            <li><b>Cardiac catheterization:</b><br>This test can show blockages in the heart arteries. A long, thin flexible tube (catheter) is inserted in a blood vessel, usually in the groin or wrist, and guided to the heart. Dye flows through the catheter to arteries in the heart. The dye helps the arteries show up more clearly on X-ray images taken during the test.</li><br>
            <li><b>Heart (cardiac) CT scan:</b><br> In a cardiac CT scan, you lie on a table inside a doughnut-shaped machine. An X-ray tube inside the machine rotates around your body and collects images of your heart and chest.</li><br>
