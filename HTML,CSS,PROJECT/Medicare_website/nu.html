        <h1>Neurological Treatment</h1>
        <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
           <p> Your health care provider will examine you and ask about your personal and family medical history.<br><br>
            
            To diagnose a nervous system disorder, a healthcare provider starts with a physical exam. They may also use one or more of these tests:<br><br>

            <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
            
            <li><b>CT scan:</b><br>This imaging test uses a combination of X-rays and computer technology to create detailed images of any part of the body, including bones, muscles, fat, and organs. CT scans are more detailed than general X-rays. They are used to diagnose disorders of the brain, spine, or other parts of the nervous system. </li><br>
            <li><b>Electroencephalogram (EEG): </b><br><br>This test records the brain's continuous electrical activity through electrodes attached to the scalp.</li><br>
            <li><b>MRI: </b><br> This test uses a combination of large magnets, radio waves, and a computer to make detailed images of organs and structures within the body. MRI creates images with much more detail than CT scan without radiation.</li><br>
            <li><b>Electrodiagnostic tests, such as electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction velocity (NCV)</b><br>These tests evaluate and diagnose disorders of the muscles and motor neurons. Electrodes are inserted into the muscle or placed on the skin overlying a muscle or muscle group. Electrical activity and muscle response are recorded.</li><br>
            <li><b>Arteriogram (angiogram):</b><br>This X-ray of the arteries and veins detects blockage or narrowing of the blood vessels.</li><br>
            <li><b>Spinal tap (lumbar puncture):</b><br>During this test, a special needle is placed into the lower back, into the spinal canal. This is the area around the spinal cord and nerves. The pressure in the spinal canal and brain can then be measured. A small amount of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can be removed and sent for testing to find out if there is an infection or other problems. CSF is the fluid that bathes the brain and spinal cord. </li><br>
            </ul>
